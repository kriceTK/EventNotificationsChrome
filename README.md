EventNotificationsChrome
========================

This is for a Chrome extension that reads events from the Team Liquid calendar and sends you notifications when an event you care about is starting


To install go to chrome://extensions, click enable developer mode and then load unpacked extension and choose the folder that this is in. Go to http://www.liquiddota.com/calendar/?view=week&team=165 and it should pop up.

Thanks
